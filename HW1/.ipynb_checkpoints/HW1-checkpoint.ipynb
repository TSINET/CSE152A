A point $(x, y)^\\top$ on the real 2D plane can be represented in homogeneous coordinates by a 3-vector $(wx, wy, w)^\\top$, where $w \\neq 0$ is any real number. All values of $w \\neq 0$ represent the same 2D point. Dividing out the third coordinate of a  homogeneous point $(x, y, z)$ converts it back to its 2D equivalent: $\\left( \\displaystyle\\frac{x}{z}, \\displaystyle\\frac{y}{z} \\right)^\\top$.\n",
